## About Project
Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. <br>

Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. <br>

I am considering variables as season, yr,mnth, holiday, weekday, workingday, weathersit, Temp, atemp, hum, windspeed, casual, registered to predict the count of total rental bikes That will be required. <br>
